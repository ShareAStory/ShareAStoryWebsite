Share A Story project

Purpose / Initial idea
What could help older adults cope with the changes to our lives arising from the COVID-19 crisis?  Loneliness and isolation are known to influence health and well-being negatively, while social support can act as a buffer against stress.  My idea is to develop a user-friendly audio, video and text-based platform to enable older adults to share autobiographical stories and connect with others. The platform would enable matching by place of origin or interests or perhaps year of birth. My hope would be to achieve this in the next two months.  It is proposed that GitHub would be used to enable people to work on the project.
The main features would be sharing a 10-minute video or short typed story (500 words maximum), upload it, then others can listen or read it. There would be a facility to comment on the stories.   A second feature would be connecting to other users of the platform; those with whom users have been matched or found by a search. 
Safety is a major consideration. The platform would be built upon cloud technology and be password-protected. The software would need to recognise hate speech, other inappropriate content or if users are at risk so that action can be taken.  
Monitoring and maintenance of the platform would be essential to ensure the system is working properly.  In relation to sustainability, this would start as a voluntary project to offer a useful resource at a challenging time.
I have never done something like this before and would love to collaborate with people, to share, learn and create.  

Target Audience 
50+ age range and be suitable for all genders. 

Requirements 
1.	Have a simple and easy to use interface, not too much content. Has accessibility features such as font enlargement, screen reader compatible etc. 

2.	A simple form needs to be created, so that users can create an account and access the website easily. 

3.	Built upon the highest privacy, safety and ethical standards for use of personal information for vulnerable people. This platform has to be trustworthy and allow the user to access the data locally. 

4.	There would be three graphical options to pick from. The first option will be to share a story option and everyone who first signed up will be recommended to do this first. A user has a limit of 10 minutes to record a video or audio recording of themselves, telling their background story or they can type their story with a limit of 500 words. Once the story has been recorded or typed, there will be a recommendation system which will match with other people who, for example came from the same school. After the first story has been created, it will automatically create a profile for them. This story will be shared around to their other friends they have already searched for or to matches they found who could have been old friends. Once, the first story has been created and shared, then they can create as many stories as they like and can be shared amongst their friends or keep them on their profile. 

5.	The video recording facility would have to be voice controlled or they can select the record button. Each step of process of creating a story, would need to be spoken out or you can disable this. 

6.	When recording the video or typing the story, there would have to be a voice and video analyser or text scanner to stop the use of hate crime, bullying or any form of abusive behaviour. Before the user can upload the story, the system will analyse the video or text to make sure it is appropriate and safe. If risk or inappropriateness were detected, then the user will be banned from the website. This would be the most important feature of the website. 

7.	There would need to be a voice checker to make sure risk is monitored. If the user tells of suicidal or distressing behaviour, a helpline will be offered. A relative will also be notified, as you can enter a family contact number when setting up the profile. Also, when entering extra information in the profile setup, you can notify that the user has dementia. This will make sure the monitoring system can act accordingly. 

8.	All stories which have been recorded will be shown on a timeline and either they can share the story or can keep it private for themselves. 

9.	The second option would be to search for friends and it will be wh+++ere the recommendations will appear for matches from their story. 

10.	The third option, will be a community space were multiple people can speak to each other and without interferences issues.
